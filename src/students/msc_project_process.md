# MSc thesis process guidelines

> Note: This document does not replace or supersedes any documentation produced by EEMCS or TU Delft, but merely explains them slightly more specific to the context of the projects withing the ABS group. In case of doubt, the documentation of EEMCS is leading.

## Introduction

This document describes typical phases of an MSc thesis project performed within the Accelerated Big Data Systems (ABS) group (abs.ewi.tudelft.nl). The description relates the typical activities and deliverables of these phases to the required competences, skills and knowledge as stated in the **Thesis Assessment Grading Scheme of the EEMCS faculty (shown in bold)**. 
The grading scheme is available [here](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/eemcs-student-portal/education/graduation-msc/assessment/).

For the typical project that students can perform within ABS group, students work in the following global phases after which some deliverables are produced. The phases can be executed over multiple iterations, so the below description determines roughly when *initial versions* of the deliverables should be completed. Depending on the context of the project, the exact deliverables may vary upon agreement with the supervisors.

1. General remarks (Month 0)

    - The student must get the thesis entry permit (TEP)

    - The student must communicate regularly with peers and supervisors, at the initiative of the student. Typically, weekly meetings are held. **[Grading scheme: 2. initiative, 2. interaction with peers/supervisors]**

    - Each deliverable mentioned below immediately contributes to the final thesis.

2. Plan of Approach (Month 1 to 2)

    The project description given to the student must be clarified by the student into a Plan of Approach that includes:
    
    - Thorough analysis and criticism of the project description based on literature study. **[Grading scheme: 1. research methods/design, 2. critical attitude]**
    - Reformulation of the problem statement, research questions and goals, based on the analysis. **[Grading scheme: 1. Scientific significance, 2. critical attitude, 3. content]**

    - List concrete objectives and deliverables. **[Grading scheme: 2. planning]**

    - An initial project planning based on the list of objectives with time estimation. **[Grading scheme: 2. planning]**

    *Activities: 10 minute presentation of above deliverables at initiative of the student*

3. Alternative solutions (Month 3)

    There are 2 possible general flavors for a project:

    - Design-oriented project

        The student typically delivers:
  
        - Requirements specification (for example using the MoSCoW method) **[Grading scheme: 1. research methods/design]**

        - Architectural alternatives, (qualitative or quantitative) comparison of the alternative and motivation of selection **[Grading scheme: 1. research methods/design, 2. creativity]**

        - Estimation of relevant characteristics (performance, space, time, energy, other resources, related to the requirements, using known or new models, e.g. Amdahlâ€™s law, roofline model, etc.) **[Grading scheme: 2. critical attitude, 1. research method/design, 1. application/development of theory]**
  
    - Modeling/theory-oriented project

        The student typically delivers (if applicable):
 
        - Alternative model/algorithm solutions, (qualitative or quantitative) comparison and motivation of selection

        - Characterization of inputs and outputs of the model/algorithm **[Grading scheme: 1. research methods/design, 1. application/development of theory]**

        - Characterization of the components relevant to model **[Grading scheme: 1. research methods/design, 1. application/development of theory]**

        - Discussion of abstraction levels (modeling, simulation) **[Grading scheme: 1. research methods/design, 2. creativity]**

    *Activities: 15 min mid-term presentation of above deliverables at initiative of the student.*

4. Thesis committee form (Month 6)

    The student should agree with the supervisor on the composition of the thesis committee and submit the [thesis committee form](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/eemcs-student-portal/education/forms/msc-forms/) to the student administration. Check the regulations for choosing the committee members on the form.

5. Implementation and results phase (Month 7)

    The student typically delivers:
    - A working prototype/proof-of-concept of the selected architecture, constructed using a structural implementation approach. **[Grading scheme: 1. research methods/design, 1. application/development of theory, 2. creativity]**

    - Measurements of at least the relevant characteristics (related to the requirements). **[Grading scheme: 1. interpretation of the results]**

    - Plots, tables, and discussion of results. **[Grading scheme: 1. interpretation of the results]**

    *Activities: 10 min presentation of above deliverables at initiative of the student.*

6. Thesis and final examination form (Month 8)

    The thesis document is the showcase of your work, and the only thing some of the committee members will see (with the presentation).

    - The student should agree on an outline for the thesis with the supervisors before writing. Use the [outline](msc_project_outline.md) as an example. **[Grading scheme: 2. initiative, 2. interaction with peers/supervisors, 3. all]**

    - The aforementioned deliverables can be combined to form the thesis. The student writes the thesis text in such a way that it forms a coherent story. It is recommend to use the [hourglass model](https://web.archive.org/web/20170928084822/https://www.unbc.ca/sites/default/files/assets/academic_success_centre/writing_support/hourglass.pdf) to construct the final version of the thesis. **[Grading scheme: 3. all]**

    - The student should carefully proofread the thesis using a spellchecker and a grammar tool such as grammarly.com

    - The student should agree on a specific defense date with the committee and submit the [final examination form](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/eemcs-student-portal/education/forms/msc-forms/)

    *Activities: Discuss the thesis with the supervisor.*

7. Presentation and thesis upload (1 week before defense)
    
    - The student should upload the final version of the thesis to the TUDelft repository.
   
    - The student prepares slides and practices the presentation. Discuss the slides with the supervisors. **[Grading scheme: 4. all]**

    *Activities: 30 min final presentation and defense.*
